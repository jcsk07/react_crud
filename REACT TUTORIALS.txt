
------------------------CREATING A REACT APP------------------

to create a react app we use the following code:-

select the directory where you want to place the react app and type the following command:-
1)Open command prompt
2)cd Desktop
3)npx create-react-app my_react

in above the my_react is the name of the folder which is the react app 

-------------------------LAUNCHING THE REACT APP----------------
in order to launch the react app we just follow the following steps:-
1)cd my_react
2)npm start

This will automatically launch the react application in the browser with the address 
       "localhost:3000"

-------------------IMPORTANT NOTES----------------------

to write the code in the react we should need to know about the ES6 scripting syntax

every part in the react is used as a component with multiple functions in it.

--------------first editing the page into the hello world------------

to edit go to the App.js file as it is the place where the component of the id "root" is returning
the data 

REPLACE THE CLASS AS FOLLOWS:-

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    //here we are returning the basic html code as the response to the index.html div tag
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>hello world</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}


this will automatically change the page as the hello world

---------------VARIABLE DECLERATIONS IN THE JS------------
to declare a variable we use the let,const functions 
to access the variables in the html pages we just place the variable in the flower braces.

let x=5;
const v=5;
these produces the same result 5
EG:-

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    //here we are returning the basic html code as the response to the index.html div tag
    const name = 'hello this is chandu';
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>{name}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

in above i declared a variable with constant function named as "name" 

when we save and runt the react page we get the data present in the name

------------------CREATING THE COMPONENTS ----------------

To create a component we should create the componnt in the js file such as App.js 

the components are build with the classes.The following is the basic syntax:-

class class_name extends Component{
	render(){
	return(
	<div></div>
	);
	}
}

in above render() is a function in the class app.

----------------TAKING PARAMETERS INTO THE COMPONENTS--------

this.props is a object which helps us to pass the parameters through the classes from main class to sub class
